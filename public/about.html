<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am learning to be a Front End Developer.</p>

<p>I live in a LWB Sprinter van with my husband and we thoroughly enjoy working and travelling our way across the UK.  We are hoping to travel to 
  Europe next year; maybe France and Spain. 
</p>

<p>We have another ambition; we are hoping to convert our second van in 2024.  Our next project will be a luton van, so that we can have a little 
  more living space and dedicated office space, so that we do not have to pack our computers away each evening. 
  Lots to do and plenty to see!
